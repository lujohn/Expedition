# Expedition (Settlers of Catan Clone)

This program is an implmentation of the popular Settlers of Catan basic version. It supports up to 4 players and has all features/rules of the original game including: trade (with other players, ports, or bank) settlements/cities, development cards, and robber.

# Rationale
I developed this game for a few reasons:
1) To practice using Angular.js its various constructs such as directives, controllers, and services. I avoided frameworks such as d3.js, sprite.js..etc. to gain exposure to Canvas and JavaScript in general.

2) At the time I began development, I could not find a fully functioning version of the game online. Expedition was created so that I could play Catan with friends and family.

## Getting Started
A live version of this game can be found at http://tinyurl.com/kk8hk3n

## Missing Functionality
Game is still missing support for the following:
- longest road / largest army cards

## Other Developmental Details
- UI/UX needs to be revamped
